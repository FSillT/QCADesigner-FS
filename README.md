# QCADesigner-FS
QCADesigner 2.0.3 with integrated Fault-Simulator


This simulator, which has been developed at the ASIC-Reliability Group (ART) at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) is an extended version of the QCADesigner (version 2.0.3), published by the group of K. Walus [1]. 
This fault simulator is part of a master thesis [2] and has been presented in [3] and [4] (all works and related slides are located in the folder "scientific_docs"). This tool is free to use and to modify. However, you must add following references in case of any publication:

In order to install the tool, extract the file QCADesigner-2.0.3-FS.tar.gz and execute the script ./install-fs.sh.
The tool has been sucessfully installed and tested at OpenSUSE 13.1 and CentOS6.
There is no Windows-Version available.
